# ðŸŒˆ Apple CLR Palettes

## What?

- TailwindCSS v2


## Install

Open terminal and run:
```
cd $HOME/Downloads && git clone https://github.com/IORoot/macos__colorpicker--palettes.git
```
This will download this repo into your home /Downloads folder.

Load any palette into any supporting Apple CLR software. (Default apple color-picker, colorslurp, etc...)


## Usage

You can install this file into your apple color-picker by running the colourpicker and selecting the following options:

```
colourpicker > Colour Palettes > (...) circle icon with three dots > open
```

## Import into Apple colorpicker panel

**Note** that you can only access the official apple macos colorpicker tool through a different program like 'apple photos', 'sketch', 'photoshop', etc..

If you wish to directly open the colorpicker tool as it's own application, see my other project that does exactly that:
